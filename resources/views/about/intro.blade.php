            Nairobi IO was founded in 2014 by Timothy Mwirabua, a young Kenyan software developer with a raging zeal to conquer the world through tech and innovation. Ambitious, he was, but perhaps a little bit naive at the time.
            <br/>
            Yes, he dropped out of university twice in (2011, 2013) because of both personal challenges in trying to fit in and because of his newly found interest in tech and "internet entrepreneurship" as it was once known. But he had also dropped out of high school and primary school... but thats a whole other story  He had an eventful childhood, playing both the soft tiny kid and the rebel.
